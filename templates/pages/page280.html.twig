    <p>
        As you begin your climb, you hear the beat of wings approaching from the west. Kraan! By the noise they are making you estimate there are at least ten, perhaps more. You curse your bad luck, for the hillside offers no cover from the sky. If you are attacked during this difficult climb, you will find it nearly impossible to fight back and remain upright at the same time.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you decide to draw your weapon and remain completely still, in the hope that the Kraan will not spot you. 
            <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="
            {{ path('page_327', {'heroId':heroId }) }}
            ">
                <img class="fleches" src="{{ asset ('assets/img/ArrowR.png') }}" />
            </a>
            {# turn to 327. #}
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you decide to quickly descend the hillside and take cover in the tunnel. 
            <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="
            {{ path('page_170', {'heroId':heroId }) }}
            ">

            </a>
        {# turn to 170. #}
