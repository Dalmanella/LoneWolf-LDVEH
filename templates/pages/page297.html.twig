        Using the skills taught to you by your masters in the art of Hunting, you inch your way through the foliage undetected. In less than a minute you are directly behind, and only a few feet from, the stake to which the ranger is tied. The wood is alight and great clouds of smoke are engulfing the poor victim. You take your weapon and run forward, hidden by the smoke. One blow of your weapon is all that is needed to sever his bonds, and you pull him free and back into the safety of the forest. As you press on into the forest, you hear the shrieks of the Giaks as they discover that their prisoner has literally disappeared in a cloud of smoke!
