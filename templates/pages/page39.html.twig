        After a few seconds, two small furry faces nervously appear over the top of the trunk. They say they are Kakarmi and tell you that the Kraan are everywhere.
        </br>
        To the west lie the remains of their village but little is left of it now. They are trying to find the rest of their tribe who took to the forest when the ‘Black-wings’ attacked.
        </br>
        They point behind them east along the path and tell you that the trail appears to be a dead end, but that if you continue through the undergrowth for a few yards more, you will find a watchtower where the path splits into three directions. Take the east path. This leads to the King’s highway between the capital city Holmgard and the northern port of Toran.
        </br>
        You thank the Kakarmi, and bid them farewell.
