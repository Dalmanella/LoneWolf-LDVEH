   <p>
        You land with such a crash on the opposite roof, that the wind is knocked out of you and you lie flat on your back with your head in a spin.
        It takes a minute or so for you to realize that youâ€™ve made it and are perfectly safe. When you are sure you are all right, you jump up and let out a shout for joy at your skill and daring.
        </br>
        Quickly you find a way across the roof and climb down a long drainpipe to the street below. 
        </br>
        You see the large iron doors of the citadel open, and a wagon drawn by two large horses tries to leave. The horses are frightened by the noisy crowd and they both rear up, causing the wagon to smash a front wheel against the door. In the confusion, you see a chance to enter and quickly slip inside just as the guards slam the doors shut.
