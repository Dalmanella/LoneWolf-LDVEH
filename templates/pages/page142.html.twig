    <p>
        You can see the tall grey-white walls and glimmering spires of Holmgard, its banners fluttering from the battlements in the fresh morning breeze. Stretching out towards the west, the River Eledil traces its course from the mountains of the Durncrag Range to the Holmgulf. But from below the mountain peaks you can see a vast black army marching relentlessly on towards the city.
        </br>
        To your right you can see the highway heading off over the rolling plain towards Holmgard. At a run you could reach the outer fieldworks of the city defences in an hour, but you would be in the open for most of the time and vulnerable to attack by Kraan.
        </br>
        However, ahead of you, a wide and muddy river drifts sluggishly towards the Eledil. You could use the cover of the river banks and swim towards the capital. Or towards your left lies the Graveyard of the Ancients. These tombs and crumbling monuments to a forgotten age would conceal your approach, but it is a forbidden area. Many are the unnamed horrors that lie there in restless sleep, waiting to consume the unwary trespasser.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you will try your luck by the highway.
        <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="

        </a>
        {# turn to 58.  #}
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you feel that you stand a better chance of reaching the capital via the river. 
        <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="
        {{ path('page_135', {'heroId':heroId }) }}

        </a>
        {# turn to 135. #}
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>Or if you are brave enough to risk the unknown perils of the Graveyard of the Ancients.
