    <p>
        Focusing your powers on the lock, you try to visualize the inner mechanism. Gradually its image appears in your mindâ€™s eye. It is old and corroded but it still functions. You are in danger of losing your concentration when a subtle click confirms that your effort has not been in vain.
        </br>
        The pin is an easier task. Slowly it rises out of the lock and falls to the floor. The granite door swings towards you on hidden hinges and the grey half-light of the Graveyard floods into the tomb. The exit is overgrown with graveweed and you suffer many small cuts to your face and hands as you fight your way through to the surface. You are startled by a sudden noise. You turn to see the disembodied head of a corpse laughing at you.
        </br>
        In blind panic, you race through the eerie necropolis towards the southern gate.
