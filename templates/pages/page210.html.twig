    <p>
        Just inside the door, you are stopped by a journeyman of the Guildhall and asked to explain your intrusion. You calmly inform him of your urgent message for the King, and he hurries you into the Guildmasterâ€™s chambers.
        </br>
        A distinguished old man in deep purple robes turns to greet you and listens to your story. Taking you by the arm, he leads you into an adjoining library and closes the door. Pressing one of the many thousands of books, he releases a secret panel in the wall and beckons you to follow him. 
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you wish to follow him into the dark passage. 
            <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="
            {{ path('page_332', {'heroId':heroId }) }}
            ">
                <img class="fleches" src="{{ asset ('assets/img/ArrowR.png') }}" />
            </a>
            {# turn to 332. #}
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you are not completely happy about this man and wish to leave the Guildhall. 
            <a class="col-12 mt-5" href="
            {{ path('page_37', {'heroId':heroId }) }}
            ">
                <img class="fleches" src="{{ asset ('assets/img/ArrowR.png') }}" />
            </a>
        {# turn to 37. #}
    </p>
