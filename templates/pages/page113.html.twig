    <p>
        You have been walking for over half an hour when your eye is caught by some bright red flowers growing near to a mossy bank.
        You recognize the plants to be Laumspur, a rare and beautiful herb much prized for its healing properties.
        </br>
        Kneeling down, you pick a handful of Laumspur and place it in your Backpack.
        You may eat this herb to regain lost <span class="nanum">ENDURANCE</span>. Each Meal of Laumspur will restore 3 <span class="nanum">ENDURANCE</span> points, and you have gathered enough for two such Meals. 
        </br>
        Closing your pack, you continue your mission.
        </br></br>
        <i>Each Meal of Laumspur may be consumed when prompted for a Meal,
        in which case it fulfils the Meal requirement in addition to restoring 3 <span class="nanum">ENDURANCE</span> points. Laumspur may also be consumed at any other time to
        restore <span class="nanum">ENDURANCE</span> without having any significance as a Meal.</i>
