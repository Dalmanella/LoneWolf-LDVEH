<div>
    <p>
        You are dizzy from your wound and you stumble through the trees like a blind man.
        </br>
        Suddenly you fall forward as if the ground has been snatched from beneath your feet. You have fallen head-first into a hunting pit. As you look up, you can see four Drakkarim levelling their bows at you, evil sneers spreading simultaneously across their ugly faces.
        </br>
        As the world darkens, the last thing you feel are the black shafts of their arrows deep in your chest. 
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>You have failed in your mission.
