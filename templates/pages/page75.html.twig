    <p>
        Peering out carefully, you can see three green-clad men on horses racing along the bank. You recognize them as Border Rangers, the regiment of the Kingâ€™s Army that police the western borders. One of them is wounded and is slumped over the neck of his horse.
        </br>
        Close behind follow a pack of twenty Doomwolves. Their Giak riders are firing arrows at the rangers which fall all around them. 
        </br>
        One ranger drops from his horse and rolls down the river bank, a black arrow deeply embedded in his right leg.
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>If you wish to help the ranger.

            </a>
            {# turn to 260. #}
    </p>

    <p>If you wish to stay hidden and drift downstream.
