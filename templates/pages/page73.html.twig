    <p>
        Pulling your green cloak about you, you blend into the foliage and rocks. Peering carefully up at the track, you are shocked to see that they are not the Kingâ€™s men at all.
        </br>
        They are Drakkarim, some of the Darklords cruellest troops.
        They must have disguised themselves as soldiers of the King in order to get this far into the forest. Thanking your Kai training for saving your life, you silently slip away from the stream and push on into the forest.
