        He tells you his name is Trimis and he is a soldier in Prince Pelathar’s army. The Prince and his troops are engaged in battle to the south, where a large force of the Darklords’ creatures are attacking the bridge of Alema. During the fight, he had been snatched into the air by a Kraan, and dropped into the forest.
